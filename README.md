# MultiCloud-AI-BenchMark
Each cloud offers different strengths for AI tasks, so the best model depends on the use case. This project benchmarks models from Azure OpenAI and AWS Bedrock using the same prompt to compare speed, reliability, and output quality. Results are stored and visualized through a Streamlit dashboard for clear performance comparison.
